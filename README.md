# **Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Platform**

## **Overview**

The **Stock Market Analysis and Prediction Platform** is a machine learning application designed to predict stock prices and visualize actual versus predicted performance. The project utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to analyze historical stock data and provide insights for decision-making. The platform includes an interactive web interface for displaying predictions, making it both functional and user-friendly.

This project highlights the integration of advanced machine learning techniques, data engineering, and web development, showcasing a seamless end-to-end pipeline for stock market analysis.
